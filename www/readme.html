            <h1>Introduction To Ushahidi</h1>
            <p>Ushahidi (meaning “testimony” in Swahili) was originally a website that was quickly developed to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the beginning of 2008.</p>

                <p>The new Ushahidi Engine incorporates the lessons learned from Kenya to create a platform that can be deployed by anyone to collect and visualize information, especially crisis information.</p>

                <h1>System Requirement</h1>
                There are a few minimum server requirements to run Ushahidi:

                    <li>PHP version >= 5.2.3</li>
                    <li>An HTTP Server. <a href="http://kohana.com">Kohana</a> which Ushahidi is built upon is known to work with: Apache 1.3+,Apache2.0+,lighttpd, and MS IIS</li>
